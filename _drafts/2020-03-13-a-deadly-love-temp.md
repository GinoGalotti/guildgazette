The adventure guild pleased with your efforts, they have also provided some developments that Frederik (the inkeeper) shared about the situation in Salty Waters. Find attached the report he sent:

* Membership tavern, hidden way of showing contracts. If they are paying for the membership they can use the services. 
* We learned from the guild that rumours of the magical relics connecting to something called the Momument of the Ages, old magical ruins cattered through the world.
* Amos went through one of them when he was young, and pointed us on that direction. He also talked about the Map of the Ages which contains the location to some of them, so he went back home to retrieve it / consult his family.
* Each monument seem to be tied to a language. The first one, Abyssal (very similar to Celestial) started as a beatiful column in a pool of water. “Up and down they go and travel, but never do they move an inch.” Solution: Stairs was the way to enter
* The first room contained 3 coloured stones applying three curses: One can only talk when others talk, One cringes when hearing S, and one has to start and finish the phrases with S. “At my feet lies three stones to hold dear. The source of three gifts that no one should bear. The keepers of secrets, the guardians of exits. Let the guessing begin, because shit’s gonna’ get hectic.”
* A very polite room was home of Grimlock, the Zealot of Etiquete. You could only pass the room if you were polite.
* There were 3 doors on the next one, one causing us harm, one bringing us forward and something that we didn't open. We also found a Mustache, Ash rod, Leather Gloves with JM and a set of Bone dice
* Then a room where we had to follow Dalti example's and paint with out own blood.... “Use your head to paint me red, inside of thee resides your key.”
* The last room was a platform on a pool of lava. Torches were lited by magical colours, but we found Mak just going through the contents of the chest. He just wanted to walk us, tricking us to focus on the chest. It was full of poison! Battling with this necromancer we learned he was part of _Bright Burning Sun_ (the demonologist cult), and found one of the Stones of Jordans and a Relic that wasn't attuned to him.
* Ezekiel felt drawn towards that mystical necklace...
