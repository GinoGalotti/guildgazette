## Zordrak the demonologist

After causing havok on **Brighthaven**, we lost track of this individual.  
His plans seem to be connecting the material plane with the infernal one, bringing demons to this world. Unknown motives.  
He seems to be collecting **relics** to use them as conduits to open portals, and **Stones of Jordan** to harvest energy from other planes.
