I will try to expand on it someday. Probably even today. Nah. Not today. For now: we're just a bunch of misfits. 

## Falaph√§l the Smart

Tall. Talkative. Noisy. Most times you can stop listening to him and you won't even miss anything.  
He thinks he's the sexiest man alive. His grandad taught him everything he knows about being a con artist and thievery. It comes in the blood.

## Boo BurntSmell

Quite smart for how he looks. He seems to fix everything with fire.  
He has a tragic story: his village was burnt down when he was a little thing, but his mother helped him out of it. That's where he met **Blank Name**, a strange human full of tattoos that took care of him and taught him to control the magic that Boo felt inside. He's one of the last goblins around, and grew up larning the basics of human society.

## Ezekiel the Mighty

Barely says a word, and when he does we talks about Gods and things. But he knows how to swing a sword.  
He's a bounty hunter, always proving his strength and seeking new and powerful foes to beat. He wouldn't pursue killing for the sake of it, but he'll avenge anything that goes against his beliefs.

## Leoric the barely-alive

Will only talk after an ale, but won't stop drinking till he can't talk anymore. He seems to like pain.  
He lived in the mines. Long family of miners. He's way too old to keep that work and, not knowing any better, he just decided to go out and adventure... maybe he can find some answers out there. He keeps trying to find those answers every night on a bottle. No luck so far.

## Amos I-will-stab-you-twice

Sneaky and deadly, he learned to track down any beast by its scent. Sometimes he also just follow the tracks.  
Long lineage of explorers, trackers and trasure hunters; he recently lost his dad to an illness from one of his adventures. He seeks exploring uncharted territories!

## Elizabeth McArthy III

What can I say of this gorgeous piece of art? Smart. Beautiful. Strong. Rubs oil like no other.

## The rest

Friends come and go. Like the wind. That is life. Do you expect me to remember their names? Fuck no.
