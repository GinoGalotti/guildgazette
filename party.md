I will try to expand on it someday. Probably even today. Nah. Not today. For now: we're just a bunch of misfits. 

## Falaph√§l the Smart

Tall. Talkative. Noisy. Most times you can stop listening to him and you won't even miss anything.

## Boo BurntSmell

Quite smart for how he looks. He seems to fix everything with fire.

## Ezekiel the Mighty

Barely says a word, and when he does we talks about Gods and things. But he knows how to swing a sword.

## Leoric the barely-alive

Will only talk after an ale, but won't stop drinking till he can't talk anymore. He seems to like pain.

## Elizabeth McArthy III

What can I say of this gorgeous piece of art? Smart. Beautiful. Strong. Rubs oil like no other.

## The rest

Friends come and go. Like the wind. That is life. Do you expect me to remember their names? Fuck no.
