Relics are powerful artifacts connected to one of more planes. Each one of them resonates with a small group of souls which stories connect to them in some level.  
Each relic draws power from those planes, and it can completely shape how they look and act. This objects can also be attached to other items, and will grow with the owner who's imbued to them.  
The guild's magical Conclave is studying them, as well as other organizations...
