As requested, this is a short summary of the news that the Adventurer's Guild has collected on the 11th Week. It is a compilation of things related to your deeds and relevant events happening in the world. At the bottom, you can read some developments on cases that the Guild will need help with.

## The Three Troubadours

A jovial trio of three Jongleur and Troubadours are spreading stories and tales from a group of adventurers, and those tales seem to match your assignment on Shimmerford (The Mosquito Witch). 

They started by telling the story of their _unstopabble death_ on a carriage, but people were more interested in the adventurers of the tale. They started to collect stories about you (and invent others). The Guild got several requests for previous assignments from this group, but we never share that information. Some of the rumors are:

* The adventurers have no fear, that's why they fought the Mosquito Witch without hesitation. Others detail that you are undead, that's why mosquitos were not attracted to you.
* They hold an evil Goblin captive and force it to carry their belongings and use it to communicate with other evil creatures.

## Brighthaven expansion

Brighthaven is becoming an important hub and The Guild has no presence there _yet_. Three commercial companies (_Gold and Glory_, _The Tea Travelers_ and _Green Owls_) govern this settlement with the support of **Emperor Gladius** of Kelesh, serving as the expanding frontier of the kingdom to the West.

They are aggressively exploring and exploiting those lands, making **Kelesh** the only moving frontier of the decade. We aren't sure what convinced **Gladius** to make these recent moves, but many adventurers and mercenaries are flooding the city due to the endless demand for work. 

## The Story of An Undying Love

**Lady Tenesse**, known for her romantic novels, has picked up the story that occurred at the lighthouse and the published work is spreading like wildfire, probably connected to the demand of stories from these adventurers created by **The Three Troubadours**. She's using the opportunity to make good gold bringing curious visitors to the small town of Salty Waters!
