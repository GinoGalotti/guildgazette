The Adventure's Guild is pleased with your efforts, they have also provided some developments that Frederik (the innkeeper) shared about the situation in Salty Waters. Find attached the report he sent:

* The adventurers arrived in the calm and welcoming town of Salty Waters.
* They heard the story of Lord Pitrokus, the man who took the Lighthouse. He appeared three weeks ago and lured the lighthouser to open the door... and kicked him out!
* They went to visit O'Sheet (the lighthouse keeper), and learned that the town tried to take the building again with diplomacy and by force, failing in both occasions. It was time to try, but this time _for real_!
* On the way, the learned that the lighthouse was emanating a magical green light before stopping to work, and **Boo** recognized it as a sign of Necromancy...
* Some town folks shared the story of a beautiful wedding that happened months ago on said lighthouse... and it seems that Lord Pitrokus was the Groom!!
* At the location, they found undead corpses defending the entrance, so the adventurers _rightfully_ decided to end their suffering.
* Up the tower, they found Lady Vanilla as an undying creature! It was resurrected by Lord Pitrokus, but as always with Necromancy, it didn't end up as intended. She was _carefully_ dealt with, and the glorious town of Salty Waters got its Lighthouse back!
* Since then, more and more people seem to come to the town curious about the tales of the adventurous group (which didn't leave any name) and stories about the undying love and a haunted Lighthouse. Luckily one of them stayed to report and helped us all understanding the situation. I can't be grateful enough for **Becky**, what a magnificent being...

With all these, I want to endorse how efficient and helpful this group of adventurers were, although they left no name! On the other hand, I want to inform that their manners were quite aggressive and caused some despair in the townfolk. I would still grade their intervention as B-, so you could do decide appropriate compensation.
