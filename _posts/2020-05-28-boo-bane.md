We don't have much time to waste, but I've been assigned to keep a record of what happened.

* We started by visiting the Orc's camp next to Brighthaven following some disappearances. We talked with Tenzun about her gone partner.
* **Morgoth** wasn't very helpful as he just wanted to seek refuge in the city, but **Boo** put him on this place, winning the respect of the rest.
* **Dalcin**, the group Shaman, explained to us that there was nothing he could do to stop this magic. People just left without giving any reason. 
* Following their tracks we found **M'kart**, a ghost city that lost most of its inhabitants for the same reason. We decided to use one of these walkers as bait.
* After following them for hours, a portal opened! We couldn't get in fast enough, although **Istarlin** bravely jumped inside.
* We went back to **M'kart** to find more of the walkers, and get a message to the Conclave asking for help.

Marka signing off.
