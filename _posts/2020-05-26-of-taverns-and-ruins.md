Of Taverns And Ruins

After the events involving the duplicitous Hand of the Emperor (Zordrak), we've achieved a milestone in our mission. F'r amidst the tension amongst the companies and now the mistrust toward imperial envoys have we secured good faith in Brighthaven as intercessors. I've started the paperwork to establish an institution of sorts to carry out contracts in the region. A tavern front seems most sensible with Leoric's expertise in liquors, Boo's musical... abilities, Falaphäl's... charisma, well, the project is practical. We shall offer our services and receive compensation in the way of association membership fees.

As the first order of business, we intend to bolster our ranks. The help sent thus far by The Guild hasn't been constant, so *Leoric*'s vouched f'r a cousin of his. *Istarlin* is the name of the rather brawny fellow. He appears the type to not back down from a challenge. This is great f'r we need all the muscle and brain we can muster, more muscle than brain in this case.

With regards to the cultists of the Bright Burning Sun, we received a lead concerning one of the so-called Monuments of the Ages, magical ruins scattered throughout the world. Amos recalled knowledge relevant and has travelled back home f'r a map that will prove helpful in locating more of these ruins. Thus, *Boo*, Istarlin, and I headed to this one nescient of the headaches that awaited us.

The ruins were pervaded with puzzles, curses, and other treacherous contrivances. Most were hardly an inconvenience f'r our group: childish riddles and silly machines, but, hrm, I still cannot pronounce the s without involuntarily wincing. And I must admit *Istarlin*'s proved his mettle after our headbutting match and then fighting doppelgängers of ourselves. Moreover, we ran into a white-livered necromancer, a member of the demonologist cult, who employed poisons and commanded the undead. We dealt with him despite his trickery and procured one of the coveted *Stones of Jordan*.

This was a most fruitful expedition and we expect further missives from The Guild. In the meantime, we continue to straighten out the.. details small of the tavern.
