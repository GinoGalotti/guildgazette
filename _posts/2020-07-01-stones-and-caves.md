I will try to record the eventful days that have come.

* We found that the *walkers* went through a magical portal at the bottom of a mountain, and **Istarlin** decided to jump in.
* While most of us went back to **M'kart** to find more one-way tickets (*aka walkers*), **Istarlin** explored the mine he was trapped in. He found **Larath'la** (the fey-like sorcerer) waving her fey-powered relic to dominate and attract the walkers.
* **Istarling**, on a moment of brilliance, pretended to be affected by the enchantment and, after being found, was sent to the improvised prison. As the rest of the prisoners were effectively hypnotised, security was low enough that he managed to escape and, on the way, gather one of the relics attuned to his energy: a dagger that looked exactly like his clan elder's ornamented weapon. Its powers served as a powerful tool to liberate some of the victims from the stupor, for reasons we still don't understand.
* We all jumped back in the portal and found the lab from **Larath'la**, stopping her before we could even ask some questions (a room full of notes can, conveniently, bring some answers). In the middle of that battle, **Istarlin** managed to join us.
* We continued our way through the mine till we found a room which floor was all covered in corpses, and a hooded figure (**Morkoth**) was using his scythe-looking relic to harvest Mark's soul (Tenzun's husband, the orc), hitting a colossal stone pillar with the energy of the swing.
* **Leoric** tried to communicate with him, as we just wanted a way out of this madness; till we realized that he was killing all these innocent people to open the gates to other realms... that was unacceptable!
* During the battle with **Morkoth** and his undead legion, our frenzied friend hit the pillar with his powerful relic, causing it to hum and reverberate. It seems the portal was cracked-enough to open a small rift from which a bearded demon could jump to our plane. Nothing that we couldn't deal with, tho.
* On our way back, we found many of the relics (including a pouch full of runes calling **Leoric**, and a fabulous cape with **Falaphäl**'s name); and we realize we were inside of Gold&Glory's closed mine. That's an easy way back to home, or at least that sweet work-in-progress tavern that we might call home one day. 

This we learned from the notes and contacting the Guild Wizards
* There is wall of huge magical stone pillars (**Pillars of Jordan**) that serve as a shield to insulate our realm (Material) to other realms, limiting the usage of magic in this world. Legends talk of someone constructing it to stop the fight that demons and celestials had for this plane; but there aren't many facts we could gather. The Stone room we visited was covered on some runes that **Ezekiel** recognized as *very similar to celestial*, so that might be one clue to follow (**Boo** also recognized them as very closed to what his adopted father had for tattoos)
* **Morkoth**, **Larath'la** and **Zordrak** (still MIA) came to this land to find a way to crack and open one of these pillars, hoping to reopen the channels to other realms. It's still unknown if that's the true reason, or if they were the only ones; but they put a lot of effort into the task.
* **Larath'la** used her fey-infused powers to attract weak souls to the mine. She couldn't control everyone (especially struggling with those strong of will), that is why she started with two groups that were already partly on their control: The orcs regularly consumed Demon-blood to berserk and gain power, and that was provided by **Zordrak** as part of their contracts, making it easier for her Fey powers to affect them; and the priests of **M'kart**, desperate for their lack of resources, made a deal with the sorcerer to enhance their water supply with nutrients, not knowing that she was also making them susceptible to her powers.
* **Morkoth**, on the other hand, used his death-infused relic and powers to harvest the soul of these captives and hit the pillar with that energy as a way of breaking it. After many attempts, they found that if the victim had strong emotions while being harvested, the energy of their souls would be stronger. He managed to weaken the pillar enough that it seemed about to break, although maybe it was already too late after our berserk dwarf hit it with one of the relics...
* **Zordrak** seemed to be collecting relics and powerful artifacts to help with this task, gathering many of the soul-bonded items that seem connected to one plane or another, although they are only usable if a certain soul is attuned to it. He also gathered many other artifacts like the **Stones of Jordan**, pieces of this inter-planes shield that allowed him to create small rifts between them. Many of those were gathered through the millennia by goblin scavengers, which made him hunt and collect them during the past centuries...
