As requested, this is a short summary of the news that the Adventurer's Guild has collected on the 12th Week. It is a compilation of things related to your deeds and relevant events happening in the world. At the bottom, you can read some developments on cases that the Guild will need help with.

## The Three Troubadours

This jovial trio continued spreading stories and rumors about your adventurer's group. Rumors came about a fight with demons, so visited Brighthaven to start gathering some of those stories.

Many of those stories are starting to come to our sources. Apparently, Marka (an Orc bandit) provided them with detailed descriptions of the events, although a lot of the trivia was centered around Leoric and his stoic sense of duty. 

## Conclave about the Stone of Jordan

Your summary was the most concerning. The information has been passed to the Conclave, our Magic council. We could gather little information so far, but we are trying to get some more information. We will share as soon as we discover it:

* **Stones of Jordan** are very unique artifacts that seem to have a connection with other planes, especially elemental planes. It is not clear where do they come from, but some arcanist has studied them over the centuries.
* Legends talk about a time where our plane (Material) was easier to reach from other planes, causing an era of constant extraplanar invasions. Something stopped them, and in our current time, it is very complicated to open a portal out of our plane.

## Brighthaven's politics 

**Murdha**, leader of Gold&Glory on Brighthaven, has stepped out of the position, leaving a power vacuum while a successor is elected. We think it is related to the information you shared about her involvement with **Lord M’Kranitos**.

## Ruler M’Kranitos on the other side of the desert

There is little we know of the situation over the desert. The few merchants who travel to the exotic land talk about a lustrous kingdom getting more lavish by the day. 

Commerce and production seem to be improving dramatically so more merchants are drawn to visit their land, but it is still a dangerous and difficult road.
