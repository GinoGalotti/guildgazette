Report for the guild:

* On Friday morning we were summoned on the government building to report any findings on our case.
* We shared that **Murdha** (G&G leader) had the motives for burning the vault, as it contained the proof that she was confabulating with the ruler on-the-other-side-of-the-desert. That has many consequences, but it put us on the spot on _how did we get to the vault before it burned down_...
* Luckily, **Leoric** recognized **Z'Von** (the Emperor's hand) as the hooded man causing the fire, but as soon as we confronted him, he ran away calling the guard! Apparently, the government guards were Orcs-in-disguise working for **Z'Von**, so they kept the company leaders busy!
* Following **Z'Von** (aka **Zordrak**), he leads us to a hidden room acting as his study. There we found **Harkur**, his lieutenant, and some other guards; as well as a myriad of contractions and demonologist symbols! We created a wall of fire to distract us while activating a **Stone of Jordan** to open a demon-summoning portal!!
* While we were fighting for our lives, **Zordrak** was focusing on gathering his artifacts and journals; till **Amos** made him get in a panic and he ran away leaving some behind! 
* Finishing the remaining demons and taking **Harkur** capturing, we took our time to catch our breathe and gather the **Zordrak**'s belongings. The journal was half burnt and we needed the support of the librarian to translate it from Infernal, but we managed to understand these notes.

## Notes from Zordrak's journal

* Zordrak seems very interested in grabbing some stones called **Stones of Jordan**. It requires more investigation, but it seems they're powerful conduits that allow connecting with other planes, so he was activating them in a way to summon Demons.
* He seems to be collecting these **Stones of Jordan** for a very long time. When he first found them, he realized some Goblin tribes hoard them as powerful catalysts for their rudimentary magic, so he and his orc army rampaged those settlements to collect them.
* That's the reason why he magically destroyed the entrance of the mines dug by G&G, and got the **Stone** from TeaTraveler's vault.
* He also seems interested in powerful **relics**, like the ones G&G found on the mine. These powerful artifacts seem to be connected to some souls on an element level: some living creatures resonate with some elements, and these relics channel a connection to a given element's plane. He was studying them and theorises they could be destroyed for creating an even bigger portal. (Notes from the adventurers: We lucky enough to find two of these powerful objects, any information you could gather about them would be precious to us!)
* He seems to be one of the hands stirring the people into accepting nad joining the **Bright Burning Sun** demonologist cult, we should keep an eye because they seem to be more numerous than expected.

## Developments on Brighthaven

The companies are really on edge after this situation, but it seems that having a common enemy has really brought them together. The emperor has condemned **Z'Von**, but the companies don't trust contacts from the empire any more. They really need all the muscle and brain they can gather, so they are happy to start some contracts with the guild.

They are also starting an elite group seeking answers on this Demon matter. They asked us to stay in contact in case they needed anything and offered to keep us on the loop if we needed it.

## Answer from the guild

_We are really pleased with the astonishing developments you've carried on **Brighthaven**, the deals that we've started with the companies in the city are incredibly profitable. Please accept our most felt congratulations. We would also want to promote you to our rank as **Expert squad**, and we would love to have a name for your squad_
