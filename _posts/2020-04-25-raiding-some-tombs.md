I got assigned to write a report for the Guild. So a report I am writing. 

* You got hired to explore a desert ruin that couldn't be cleared before. They were stopped and couldn't find any way to progress. People give up way too fast.
* They were ruins from a thousands-year-old civilization. The rhinos and crocodiles obsessed civilization. **Amos** said that. He seems to know these things.
* The door was guarded by 4 relic stones: Mountains, gravestones, thin-as-fuck-people, and history. 
* We punched our way into the temple. There are 6 rune slots where to put the tablets we found, and **Leoric** masterfully puts everything on its place. Without killing anyone. Even if I had to dive in the sand to save **Amos**. No breath, no gain.
* We got sucked into a sand vortex and spat on the room underneath.
* We see three walls depicting the pass of time on nature, society, and human; with a chiseled glorious statue of a judge holding and ankh and a crook. Couldn't punch it. It must be magical.
* We got the ankh from the hand, activating the construct and having to fight with it. The fight was daunting, but nothing that can't be stopped with the right biceps. It dropped some artifacts.
* People seemed happy with our results. 

That is it. Gerardo out

With all these, I want to endorse how efficient and helpful this group of adventurers were, although they left no name! On the other hand, I want to inform that their manners were quite aggressive and caused some despair in the townfolk. I would still grade their intervention as B-, so you could do decide appropriate compensation.
