I got asigned to write a report for the Guild. So a report I am writing. 

* You got hired to explore a desert ruin that couldn't be cleared before. They were stopped and couldn't find any way to progress. People give up way too fast.
* They were ruins from a thousands-year-old civilation. The rhinos and crocodile. obssesed civilation. **Amos** said that. He seems to know these things.
* The door was guarded by 4 relic stones: Mountains, gravestones, thin-as-fuck-people and history. 
* We punched our way into the temple. There are 6 rune slots where to put the tablets we found, and **Leoric** masterfully puts everything on its place. Without killing anyone. Even if I had to dive in sand to save **Amos**. No breate, no gain.
* We got sucked into a sand vortex and spitted on the room undernearth.
* We see three walls depicting the pass of time on nature, society and human; with a cisceled glorious statue of a judge holding and ankh and a crook. Couldn't punch it. Must be magical.
* We got the ankh from the hand, activating the construct and having to fight with it. The fight was daunting, but nothing that can't be stopped with the right biceps. It dropped some artefacts.
* People seemed happy with our results. 

That is it. Gerardo out

With all these, I want to endorse how efficient and helpful this group of adventurers were, although they left no name! On the other hand, I want to inform that their manners were quite aggressive and caused some despair on the townfolk. I would still grade their intervention as B-, so you could do decide an appropriate compensation.
