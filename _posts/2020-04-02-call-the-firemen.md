## Thursday - 10:30
Dear diary,
How are you today?
I met this new guy, **Amos**, and gosh, his scimitars, so shiny and big… But we had business to do, so we joined the others at the inn. So rude, not even the time for a refreshment, like a sex-on-the-beach or something that they were already dragging me to this place, the _TeaTravellers_ HQ. 
Let me tell you, that place is a disaster! Someone should tell them that the fake poor is not in style anymore, especially if you decide to go all-in and sort out a (very realistic, I must admit) burnt-down room. My coat still smells like smoked meat, ugh! But it was useful, it seems like we might be able to get some contacts at the _GreenOwls_ HQ, as they are taking care of the investigations and might need some extra help. We’ll see.

## Thursday - 12:30
Dear diary,
OH MY GOBLINS! I think I am in love.
We just walked in the _GreenOwls_ place and there he stood, in all of his magnificent presence, white hair flowing on his shoulders, perfectly pointy ears, and those eyes… I will not even stop talking about those shoulders, you know my dear diary.
His name is **Flerek**. Isn’t it absurd how many things we have in common? My name starts with F as well! Imagine the wedding invitations: 

> F & F 
> invite you to…

And he was so sweet, trying to keep the conflict at bay between the _TeaTravellers_ and those _Gold&Glory_ guys (ehehehheh if you say it out loud it sounds like golden glory, eheheheheheheheheheeh), which comes perfectly at our advantage, as we can be their super-partes investigator.
My soon-to-be-man told us some more about the suspects on this whole story, especially that _G&G_ seemed the most probable culprits for what happened at the _TeaTraveller_, ‘cause of some artifacts and mines problems, an explosion, maybe _TeaTravellers_ are responsible, blablabla (wasn’t really listening, his hair was moving so softly in the low breeze at the doorframe of his office…).
We had to go for now, with the promise of returning to my love as soon as we could.
Every second not spent with him is a stab on my delicate heart.

## Thursday - 13:45
Dear diary,
gosh, so much walking these days!
The small one and the new one went to the library, not sure why I was too distracted saying bye to **Flerek**…
Meanwhile, I and **Ezekiel** went to the Church to see if we could find some useful information there.
Also, you know me… while **Ezekiel** was keeping one of the “priests" busy, I decided to wander around the building a while… 
My thievery skills are always on top, you know that… But blinded by the memory of the beauty of **Flerek**, I just tripped on the side of the big chair in the room I entered... Someone must have heard that, and I had only the time to get my hands on a tiny black book (no way I would carry around that giant book with the sun on it! What am I, a donkey?) full of numbers and a weird language. **Ezekiel** could get some words out of it, thanks to those church-after-school-days of his, studying celestial, but not too much anyway. Maybe at the library, they can help…?

## Thursday - 15:30
Dear diary, 
Indeed they could!!!
We learned that there is a cult of demonologists (**Bright Burning Sun**) which is growing in the city and tries to bring cleansing on humanity (???) through bringing the Demons to our material plain (???). You tell me if that makes sense to you, ‘cause to me, it doesn’t.
Also, they wrote things in infernal (of course **Ezekiel** had to study celestial instead of infernal at school, of course…) so that’s why he could get only part of the things in there.

## Thursday - 16:30
Dear diary,
So the guys find out that the sigil **Leoric** ripped off of that caped-guy is actually basically the emperor sigil!!! The mystery is unfolding in front of our eyes, I can feel it.
My loved one directed us to someone called **Oriohl**, a guy he knows (nothing romantic, I could tell) from the _Gold&Glory_ (eheheheheh). He actually knows a lot.
For example that soon the guard will finish their shift and we will have our best shot at getting into the _G&G_ vault, where maybe we can find journals and reports and all that kind of thing.
I’m telling you, darling, this will be easy-peasy, I can feel it in my thief-bones.
Meanwhile, let’s go and try to find this P. **Harkur** guy at the Government, as **Marka** told us… 

## Thursday - 18:00
Dear diary,
If only you could have seen me! I walk into that place like if it was my own, and… no one knew who the fudge **Harkur** was! WTF people, really? One of my best performances thrown to the pigs…
It seems like it might be one of the guards, but who really knows? Bha, waste of time.
Better go back to _G&G_ for the end of shift…

## Thursday - 22:00
Dear diary,
What an end of the day! We destroyed a bunch of giant windows to mess up the alarm system and with my amazing thief skills at opening locks, we managed to get into the tunnels and in the whatever-that-place-was.
And there were, two giant shiny chests… You know well what I had to do! One of them was a bitch to me, but the other opened up like a box of chocolates, to reveal a magical runic weapon **THAT THE NEW GUY SNEAKED UP AND PLACED ON HIS SCIMITAR**! Unacceptable!
But yeah, we totally forgot about the documents we were looking for, especially when a damn fire elemental came down on us with his rat-friends.
We’re all right, now, but we had to defeat that big guy and then run away cause the guards were arriving.
We got some journals on our way out, let’s see if it’s anything useful…

## P.S.
On a side note, that name **Leoric** got when he ripped off part of the caped-man cape, **Zordrak**, seems to mean something both in celestial (_The Bringer of the Truth_) and infernal (_The Bringer of the Flame_). What a weird thing…

## P.P.S.
Someone (starts with E ends in ZEKIEL) told me that I needed to add a few things, so here they are, even if they don’t seem to be of any importance to me… Whatever to make him shut up…

* We learned that **Murdha** (the boss of the _G&G_) was offering a deal to the Ruler-Over-The-Desert in order to give the city to them in a position of power on their kingdom. There is little that we know on that off-world.
* Through journals, we learned that _Gold&Glory_ (eheheheheh) was trying to get revenge on TeaTravelers, and also plotting a way to delete the incriminatory evidence they had on **Murdha** (it’s the missive Boo picked up in the fire when I wasn’t here, so defo not important).
* We learned that powerful magic-users are controlled and pursued by the government, with inquisitors having artifacts that allow them to detect powerful usages of magic.
