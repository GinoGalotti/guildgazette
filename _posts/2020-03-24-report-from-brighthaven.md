_A lot has happened in the last 24 hours!_ This is the beginning of our report!

We barely Arrived at the dusty and sandy **Brighthaven** and there was that immense and majestic golden elephant _staring at us! So big. And cold. And gold. But we had a mission to do: Get some contacts so the Guild can send new recruits and make tons of money with this situation! So we went to The Sunbathing Lizard (the local tavern), _nice local folks_ always have the _best_ answers!

**Leoric** found the _poison_ locals were drinking (_what a stench!_), and we learned that the **Tea Travelers** are providing the liquor. Well, we learned about the city's weird situation. This settlement _in the middle of knowhere_ is Emperor Gladiu's plan to expand his frontiers. The **Tea Travelers** (seems to be doing the better business), **Gold and Glory** and **Green Owls** companies are sponsoring the efforts and have a deal with the emperor, having a council where each one has a vote. That exclusive deal is why other corporations are not allowed!

On our way to _the only clean inn_, we couldn't help but stop by the _shiny and gorgeous elephant_. That's when everything got bonkers! We learned it's the headquarters of **Tea Travelers**, and we saw how someone had opened the wall with magic and was just walking out while setting everything on fire. Crazy, right? That's why **Boo** just _jumped in!_ There wasn't much time to search for things on that _hell_, so **Boo** just managed to grab a missive and _that haunted crossbow_; as well as a little piece of gold... _would be a shame to leave it to burn!_

In the meantime, **Leoric** and **Ezekiel** ran behind the hooded figure, but they only managed to see a little bit of his face and get a piece of his cloak! They faced a group of Orc mercenaries (they had their _orcishness_ magically concealed!!) which seemed to be working for that hooded man, so we took one of them with us!

Questioning **Marka**, the Orc we took with us, wasn't _entirely productive_. We learned that the band of Orcs is led by someone named **Harkur**, but she didn't know any specifics about the one _paying for the job_. They seem to be working for him for a long while. We managed to convince her to just go back and, as soon as she knows about the next job, she'll inform us so we can go get some information on **Harkur**. We think _we can trust her_...

# Other notes on the journal

## The lost missive

We found a missive that looked important. It's sent to **Lord M'Kranitos**, which we think is an emperor _on the other side of the dessert_, and it seems to beg for some help and offer the position on the city. It's signed by **Murdha Makag**... if only we knew _what's all this!_

## The marked crossbow

-- Note from Boo ---

This... symbol... it brings back _the few memories_ I have of my camp before it was attacked. I think. I haven't seen it again, I can't recall seeing this sigil... but, when I looked at it, I could feel the fire around me. I could smell the smoke and the burning flesh. I could hear the yells and cries from my family... something in my head _just yells when I look at it_.

## The note in the pocket

**Leoric** snatched a piece of the hooded man's cloak, finding a little scribbling on his pocket. It's written in Orcish, but after some investigation, we manage to roughly translate it.

_The horses are planning on setting everything on fire, it'll happen on the following week. They seem to want to get rid of something. The leaders are very scared. Harkur_
