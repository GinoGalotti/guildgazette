We visited the TeaTraveler's burnt HQ, and got pointed to GreenOwls as they're hiring private investigators to solve this mystery.
We learned from GreenOwls that they are keeping the conflict to a minimum, acting as middlemen between Gold&Glory and TeaTravelers. That's why they hired an independent investigator.
We met Flerek. He gave us a point on contact on Gold&Glory (Oriohl), and some plans on the different HQs. Gold&Glory seemed the main suspects from the beef they had due to some artefacts and Mines.
We learned about the sigil, church and Zordak. We learned the best way to get on the Gold&Glory vaults, hoping to find the document room to find their journals and reports they have to send to the company bosses.
We tried to find Harkur in the Goverment building, without much luck. The description seems to match some security guard.
We sneaked in the G&G base by creating a very noisy distraction, overwhelming the alarm system and getting in through the maintenance tunnel.
Inside, we forgot to look for documents and decided to check a very shiny metallic chest, finding inside a very unique artefact… such a cool runic weapon! I wonder what makes it so unique…
Opening the vault without security clearance trigger its defense mechanism, casting SO MUCH FIRE on us! We barely escaped, but managed to get some journals on the way.



## Leads/Clues we have:

From **Marka** we learned that Harkur (the Orc thug) can be contacted from the Government building, so he's probably working there.
From the Chruch, we learned that there is a cult of demonologists (Bright Burning Sun) which is growing in the city and tries to bring cleansing on humanity through bringing the Demons to this plane. They wrote things on infernal.
We learnt that Gold&Glory found a mine with resources and incredible magical artifacts, but shortly after they started digging in a big explosion destroyed the access of that yacimient. Everyone thinks TeaTravelers were behind that.
From the library, we learned that Zodrak means something on Celestial (The Bringer of the Truth) and Infernal (The Bringer of the Flame).
We learned that Murdha was offering a deal to the Ruler-Over-The-Desert in order to give the city to them in a position of power on their kingdom. There is little that we know on that off-world, but it can be followed.
Through journals, we learned that Gold&Glory was trying to get revenge on TeaTravelers, and also plotting a way to delete the incriminatory evidence they had on Murdha (their leader), it's the missive Boo picked.
We learned that the piece of a cloak that we got from _Zordak_ (the name on it) has a sigil very similar to the Emperor's one.
We learned that powerful magic users are controlled and pursued by the goverment, with inquisitors having artefacts which allow them to detect powerful usages of magic.
