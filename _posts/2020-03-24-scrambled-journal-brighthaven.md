_A lot has happened on the last 24 hours!_ So I better write it down before I _forget all the things!_ I would really want you to shred some light on this...

We barely Arrived to dusty and sandy **Brighthaven** and there was that inmense and majectic golden elephant _staring at us! So big. And cold. And gold. But we had a mission to do: Get some contacts so the Guild can send new recruits and make tons of money with this situation! So we went to The Sunbathing Lizard (the local tavern), _nice local folks_ always have the _best_ answers!

**Leoric** found the _poison_ locals were drinking (_what a stench!_), and we learned that the **Tea Travelers** are providing the liquor. Well, we actually learnt about the weird situation. This place _in the middle of knowhere_ is Emperor Gladius plan to expand his frontiers. The **Tea Travelers** (seems to be doing the better business), **Gold and Glory** and **Green Owls** companies are sponsoring the efforts and have a deal with the emperor, having a council where each one has a vote. That exclusive deal is why other corporations are not allowed!

On our way to _the only clean inn_, we couldn't help but stop by the _shiny and gorgeous elephant_. That's when everything got bonkers! We learned it's the headquarters of **Tea Travelers**, and we saw how someone had opened the wall with magic and was just walking out while setting everything on fire. Crazy, I know! That's why I just _jumped in!_ I couldn't find much on that _hell_, so I just managed to grab a missive and _that haunted crossbow_... that's the main reason why I'm writting to you! I really need to understand about what is going on...

In the meantime, my friends ran behind the hooded figure, but they only managed to see a little bit of his face and get a piece of his cloak! They faced a group of Orc mercenaries (they had their _orcishness_ maggically concealed!!) which seemed to be working for that hooded man, so we took one of them captive!

Questioning Marka, the Orc we took with us, wasn't _entirely productive_. We learned that the band of Orcs are leader by someone named **Harkur**, but she didn't know any specifics about the one _paying for the job_. They seem to be working for him for a long while. We maanged to convince her to just go back and, as soon as she knows about the next job, she'll inform us so we can go get some information on **Harkur**. I think _I believe her_...

I'm sending to you a picture fo the symbol burned on the crossbow. It really triggers something inside that... I don't fully understand. I know we haven't talked on a long while, but

## The lost missive

We found a missive that looked important. It's sent to **Lord M'Kranitos**, which we think is an emperor _on the other side of the dessert_, and it seems to beg for some help and offer the position on the city. It's signed by **Murdha Makag**... if only we knew _what's all this!_

## The marked crossbow

This... symbol... it really brings back _the few memories_ I have of my camp before it was attack. I think. I haven't seen it again, I can't recall seeing this sigil... but, when I looked at it, I could feel the fire around me. I could smell the smoke and the bruning flesh. I could hear the yells and cried of my family... something in my head _just yells when I look at it_.

## The note in the pocket

**Leoric** snatched a piece of the hooded man's cloak, finding a little scriblling on his poket. It's written in Orcish, but after some investigation we manage to roughly translate it.

_The horses are planning on setting everything on fire, it'll happen on the following week. They seem to want to get rid of something. The leaders are very scared. Harkur_
