We barely arrived at the dusty and sandy **Brighthaven** - what a name choice, I say! - welcomed by a huge golden elephant… these people really like to show off! I touched it, it was cold. It didn’t taste good. What a waste of gold!

Anyway, back to our mission: _Get some contacts so the Guild can send new recruits and make tons of money (I guess)!_ We went to **The Sunbathing Lizard** (the local tavern) in search of information! **Leoric** didn’t seem very fond of the refreshments offered by the barkeeper, but well, what do I know? He didn’t want to buy me food, or a cider, or anything! Not very nice of him, I say… Boo is a good goblin, you know, you should take care of Boo. 

The tavern guy told us that the **Tea Travelers** are providing the liquor (remember the giant elephant? Those guys, the showing off ones). We also learned about the city’s weird situation: its settlement in the _middle of nowhere_ seems to be Emperor Gladius’ plan to expand his frontiers (to infinity and beyond!). The **Tea Travelers** (seems to be the most profitable company) **Gold and Glory** and **Green Owls** are sponsoring the efforts and have a deal with the emperor, with a council where each of them has a vote. That is an exclusive deal, and the reason why other corporations are not allowed to make business in the city. But we are here to change the status quo! Why us, you ask? Who knows… seems they trust us enough to not make a huge mess...

On our way to the Inn that the barkeeper recommended (seems it’s a family business!), while hanging around the _shiny majestic elephant_, something unexpected happened! Some very suspicious humanoid hooded guy (I guess) opened a magical hole/door in the wall behind the statue, and was just coming out of it in a very suspicious way. What the crap, I said! And I went there to check out what was happening… in a non-very-stealthy way. Inside the wall, something was burning! There was a lot of gold and papers and weapons and other precious items… What did I do, you ask? Jumped in, of course! That’s the kind of work Detective Boo can take on: dangerous and suspicious stuff. Bring it on! Probably not the smartest idea, now that I think about it... but in the end it was worth it! There wasn’t much time to search for things in that fire hell, so I just managed to grab a missive and a _crossbow with a strange symbol on top_; as well as a “little” piece of gold… _would have been a shame to leave it there!_That piece of gold, saved my life, I have to say!

In the meantime, **Leoric** and **Ezekiel** were running behind the hooded figure -they told me afterwards - and they managed to see part of his face and get a piece of his cloak -good job guys!! The little sh.. Vile being runned away in panic, too scared to face my two brave comrades! 

They had to face a group of Orc mercenaries that seemed to be working for that suspicious hooded guy. We bravely defeated them and took a hostage for interrogation (she seemed the boss).

Questioning **Marka**, the Orc we took with us, wasn’t easy, but we could manage to get some info from her/him/it… whatever. We learned that the band of Orcs is led by someone named **Harkur**, but Marka didn’t know any specifics about the one _paying for the job (suspicioushoodedguy)_. They seem to be working for him for a while now. We managed to convince her to just go back and, as soon as she knows about the next job, she’ll inform us so we can go get some information on **Harkur**. Hope this can work… otherwise… camp is just outside of the town and we could pay a visit

## **The lost missive**

We found a missive that looked important. It’s sent to **Lord M’Kranitos**, which we think is an emperor _on the other side of the dessert_, and it seems to beg for some help and offer the position on the city. It’s signed by **Murdha Makag**… if only we knew _what’s all this!_

## **The marked crossbow**

This… symbol… it brings back _the few memories_ I have of my camp before it was attacked. I think. I haven’t seen it again, I can’t recall seeing this sigil… but, when I looked at it, I could feel the fire around me. I could smell the smoke and the burning flesh. I could hear the yells and cries from my family… something in my head _just yells when I look at it_.

## **The note in the pocket**

**Leoric** snatched a piece of the hooded man’s cloak, finding a little scribbling on his pocket. It’s written in Orcish, but after some investigation, we manage to roughly translate it.

_The horses are planning on setting everything on fire, it'll happen on the following week. They seem to want to get rid of something. The leaders are very scared. Harkur_
