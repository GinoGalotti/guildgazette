Dear diary,
Today was a mixed-feelings day.
I and Boo finally arrived into my tribe’s territory, to bring back **Jerry** (also known by his tribe name, Tikka Mallasa), or better, what’s left of Jerry after the... ehm... crossfire happened.
Mixed feelings not because of the sadness that a funeral can bring, we all know how Mwangi people treat them as a celebration of life itself, but because at some point Boo, feeling the need to redeem himself after that fireball, decided to sing... Now, I know he has this *talent* that in certain situations helped us out, but gosh, it was dreadful to hear! Like, seriously, dude...
At least my people appreciated the thought, maybe ‘cause we didn’t tell them how this ancestor of ours died, after coming back to life from centuries of rock-solid sleep, and they offered us lots of nice food -including a spicy veggie plate that reminded me of my childhood, so good!!- after the ceremony was over.

But let’s get back to the start when we got this letter from **Amos** explaining that some of the monuments he was exploring had something that might be linked to our relics, and when would I ever turn down the chance to embellish my cape, let’s be real!?
So here we are, in the middle of a jungle, mosquitos biting left and right (everyone but me, you know I am always prepared, water, toilet paper, a _towel_, and mosquitos repellant) and while we are just cutting through the deepest part of it we came across a huge mystical tree and yes, indeed, Mwangi words written on it.
Needless to say that basically, I saved the situation, translating so perfectly the inscriptions that allowed us in, what can I say, I’m just so good at _whatever_ I do...
Once in, we had to solve a riddle that took me just a second to figure out, I mean, basically, they sculpted me wearing my cape on the wall, like a prophecy, like if they considered me a GOD, how could I disappoint my peeps? Yes, sure, Boo helped too, when he got me on his shoulders to get me closer to the lantern on the ceiling and cast my shadow on that sculpture, but needless to say that I did indeed cast a super cool shadow.
And here’s when our friend **Jerry** comes into the scene. 
It was so weird, we stepped into the new room, to see a statue of a human figure and one of a basilisk.
The _small_ guys with the big muscles moved the human statue away from facing the big snake and there he was, **Tikka**, super scared and panicky. I mean, I feel you, buddy, after centuries stuck in a frightened pose, I would be cranky too. I had to stop opening the door to the next room to calm him down and be a translator for everyone. We convinced him to come with us so he wouldn't run away to all the dangers outside, you never know...
Aaaaanyway, we then had to fix a fire under a cauldron full of stinky water to reveal a trapdoor on the ceiling of the next room before the floor raising up squished us, then another sculpture of me pouring water in my sleeves and out of it, so I did it (who am I to dismiss my destiny or avoid a wet-cape contest???). We poured all the water we had and it would become red once inside the vase and, weirdest thing, if you splashed the wall with the red watery thingy, blood vessels will appear on it. But we did finish the water from out supply, so then we kinda had to _produce more liquid somehow_... but let’s not linger on details! We got to this creepy cave/room where we found shiny rocks that looked quite cool and expensive but of course, we could not just take them and go and sell them, no, **Ezekiel** had to figure out there was a weird resonance between the stones and our relics and some holes in the cave, so, sure, follow the law-guy, why not, do what people always do in horror plays, stuck the stone in the hole, go ahead...
Of course, horrible things happened after that...
I mean, yeah, we got more energy infused into our relics, it seems, but then these dudes appeared, one was a tiefling, two were angel-like people and then there was a third super hot dude with amazing tattoos all over his sleeves. Like, yeah, hot, but of course they wanted to kill us, thank you again **Ezekiel**...
Luckily enough, we’re a good team after all, so it didn’t take too much effort to just reduce them into nothingness, eheheheh.
**Boo** did this super cool thing of evoking angry monkeys that run all over the place ripping of shiny stuff from those peeps, it was hilarious! I mean, it would have been if only Boo didn’t decide to use some fire stuff to hit one of those guys and got **Jerry** at the same time, transforming him into a pile of ashes…

So now, dear diary, you know what happened.
I never thought I would get so moody because of a stranger getting killed in a fight, but maybe not having seen any of my people in so long took its toll? Did I seriously feel responsible for this guy's life, even if we just met him? Was it just because he was super hot?
I don’t know, really, but I am getting off track here…

We got some infos about this inter-planar organization that tries to keep planes independent, but I don’t remember much ‘cause my head was somewhere else, I admit it.
And that’s where I started, me and **Boo** took a trip to my homeland, he got to get a lot of food and was happy the people there didn’t hate him.
I got a couple of tattoos to remember this whole thing by, and while the old shaman was tapping away on my skin, we got to talk about Tikka and the place he told us he came from, Natha Nattan. He explained to us that is the ancient city of El Dorado is called in ancient stories from the times of demons and angels, although it has changed the name a lot through history... some called it Narak and Go’Renth these days. Its ruins are rumored to be on the Horned Peaks, but nothing has ever been found. At least for now...
Maybe it was the pain of the tapping, maybe the weird thing they get you to drink before the tattoo starts, during the ceremony, but I feel like we should try and seek some more information on this... We’ll see.

That was a very long log, dear diary... Am I losing my flavor? Am I losing my charming nature? It feels so dull right now, reading this again. 
I guess that will have to do for today, though.
Tomorrow we travel back to the others, we’ll see what they were up to in the meantime.

Always yours,
Falaphäl

P.S.
Here’s an accurate representation of Boo and the angry monkeys <3
