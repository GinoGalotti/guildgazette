Dear reader, I will write up the events that are occurring these days the best way I can, so don’t expect much. The team is back to business! We have a lot of things to investigate, and not enough time. I contacted my adoptive father - a well-known magic-user - to ask him about the symbols we found in the monuments. Are they connected to the portals to the other Realms?

Unfortunately, he seemed uncomfortable with the questions… I feel there is something he knows but doesn’t want to share.

Why? Maybe he just wants to protect his only (and beloved) son. Ezekiel and Istarlin are also gathering information on other topics, the Ghost Blood and the “angelic creatures”. No one seems to believe they do exist in this world... Ezekiel was more practical, luckily we have him to take care of our reputation and resources. Last week - it was just another ordinary morning - we heard a loud thump in the basement, that woke up some of us.

Istarlin, Ezekiel, and I went down to check, getting ready for the worst.

Surprise surprise… we found the unconscious bodies of Gerardo and Elizabeth Smith III (Becky), accompanied by a woman in a fancy purple and gold cape. She soon introduced herself as Lady Darkasian. 

She said she comes from a place called T’Telir, on the other side of the desert, where our two colleagues went on a mission.

During his time there, Gerardo got drunk and spilled the beans about our great adventures and the fact that we found the relics...

Their Lord, (M’kranitos) convinced our colleagues to lead Lady Darkasian to our location so that she can bring us to him. 
It seems they know more than us about these pillars/portals and the relics we found… The purple-gold Lady - while chatting with us - seemed quite interested in the relics we found, and at the same time concerned about the portals being open to the other Realms. It seems that if these pillars are broken, the doors will be open… and then what?
I don’t know... forgot to ask. Guess something bad is gonna happen. The people from T’Telir are making sure those portals stay closed, fighting back whatever comes out of it, at least on their side of the desert.
Lady Darkasian was quite surprised about our ignorance of the facts (pillars, portals, and so on…). Another interesting fact about their society is the Returned. They have people returning from the dead. Quite creepy, yeah...

But she seemed pretty alive to our eyes. They have some people chosen to “return”, returning as Gods, or something else.

I would compare it with our Aristocracy and noble people. 

They also can exchange life essence from one being to another. I wonder if that works with animals too. Anyway, we decided to embark on this adventure. 
Mysterious returned people, mysterious gods, portals and… most of all… mysterious vehicles called bikes…

All yours,
Boo the Orc Whisperer
