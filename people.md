The short notes that we've been keeping on the people we've met.

## The nice ones

**The Three Troubadours**: After being miraculously saved from sure death, these wordy fellows were impressed by the doings of their saviors on the town of Shimmerford. They seem to share that tale often and loudly, so more and more people seem to have heard the story...

**O'Sheet**: He lost his lighthouse to the hands of a mad man, but some nice folks took it back. He doesn't feel at ease anymore on that haunted place, but the townfolk seems to have jumped on the opportunity to find other ways to bring cash... and he's _very_ grateful for that!

**Miss Tenesee**: She decided to write a novel about that romantic tale of a necromancer in love! She's been trying to get in touch with the adventurers involved, and also have very big plans on how to bring folks to the enchanted lighthouse and make a nice business out of it...

**Hary and Peaches**: They were saved by the adventurers while they were trying to meet Lastrade. She doesn't forget herself for being so reckless and is ashamed of not showing more gratitude to her saviors.

## The bad ones

None seems to hold grunge yet.
