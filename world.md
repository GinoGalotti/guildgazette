A summary of all the relevant places and history we've visited

## Places

**Shimmerford**: A place full of mosquitoes. Not now. Now is cool. Thanks to the work of some folks

**Salty Waters**: Small. Smelly. They used to have a madman on the lighthouse. Not anymore. Thanks to the work of some folks.

**Brighthaven**: The edge of society. Where adventurers go to get glory and die.

## Rulers

**Emperor Gladius**: Ruler of the empire of **Kelesh**, including **Brighthaven**. 

**Lord M'Kranitos**: The ruler over-the-desert. There's not much reliable information about him, but that civilisation seems to be propering at a astonishing rate. That's _never a good sign_.
