A summary of all the relevant places and history we've visited

## Places

**Shimmerford**: A place full of mosquitoes. Not now. Now is cool. Thanks to the work of some folks

**Salty Waters**: Small. Smelly. They used to have a madman on the lighthouse. Not anymore. Thanks to the work of some folks.

**Brighthaven**: The edge of society. Where adventurers go to get glory and die.
